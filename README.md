This project focuses on detecting and classifying plant diseases using image processing and unsupervised machine learning techniques.
It utilizes real-world plant leaf image datasets and applies Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMM) 
for effective clustering and feature extraction. Image preprocessing techniques such as color normalization and segmentation are used 
to enhance model performance across diverse lighting conditions. A lightweight and user-friendly front-end interface built with HTML 
and CSS allows users to upload leaf images and receive real-time disease detection results. The system is  designed to support early 
diagnosis in agriculture, aiming to help farmers and researchers identify plant health issues efficiently.
